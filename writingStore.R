Preface
The Academic Phrasebank is a general resource for academic writers. It aims to provide the
phraseological ‘nuts and bolts’ of academic writing organised according to the main sections of a
research paper or dissertation. Other phrases are listed under the more general communicative
functions of academic writing.
The resource was designed primarily for academic and scientific writers who are non-native speakers
of English. However, native writers may still find much of the material helpful. In fact, recent data
suggest that the majority of users are native speakers of English.
The phrases, and the headings under which they are listed, can be used simply to assist you in
thinking about the content and organisation of your own writing, or the phrases can be incorporated
into your writing where this is appropriate. In most cases, a certain amount of creativity and
adaptation will be necessary when a phrase is used.
The Academic Phrasebank is not discipline specific. Nevertheless, it should be particularly useful for
writers who need to report their empirical studies. The phrases are content neutral and generic in
nature; in using them, therefore, you are not stealing other people's ideas and this does not
constitute plagiarism.
Most of the phrases in this compendium have been organised according to the main sections of a
research report. However, it is an over-simplification to associate the phrases only with the section in
which they have been placed here. In reality, for example, many of phrases used for referring to
other studies may be found throughout a research report.
In the current Kindle version, additional material, which is not phraseological, has been incorporated.
These additional sections should be helpful to you as a writer.

About Academic Phrasebank
Theoretical Influences
The Academic Phrasebank largely draws on an approach to analysing academic texts originally
pioneered by John Swales in the 1980s. Utilising a genre analysis approach to identify rhetorical
patterns in the introductions to research articles, Swales defined a ‘move’ as a section of text that
serves a specific communicative function (Swales, 1981,1990). This unit of rhetorical analysis is used
as one of the main organising sub-categories of the Academic Phrasebank. Swales not only identified
commonly-used moves in article introductions, but he was interested in showing the kind of
language which was used to achieve the communicative purpose of each move. Much of this
language was phraseological in nature.
The resource also draws upon psycholinguistic insights into how language is learnt and produced. It is
now accepted that much of the language we use is phraseological; that it is acquired, stored and
retrieved as pre-formulated constructions (Bolinger, 1976; Pawley and Syder, 1983). These insights
began to be supported empirically as computer technology permitted the identification of recurrent
phraseological patterns in very large corpora of spoken and written English using specialised
software (e.g. Sinclair, 1991). Phrasebank recognises that there is an important phraseological
dimension to academic language and attempts to make examples of this explicit.
Sources of the phrases
The vast majority of phrases in this resource have been taken from authentic academic sources. The
original corpus from which the phrases were ‘harvested’ consisted of 100 postgraduate dissertations
completed at the University of Manchester. However, phrases from academic articles drawn from a
broad spectrum of disciplines have also been, and continue to be, incorporated. In most cases, the
phrases have been simplified and where necessary they have been ‘sifted’ from their particularised
academic content. Where content words have been included for exemplificatory purposes, these are
substitutions of the original words. In selecting a phrase for inclusion into the Academic Phrasebank,
the following questions are asked:
• does it serve a useful communicative purpose in academic text?
• does it contain collocational and/or formulaic elements?
• are the content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) generic in nature?
• does the combination ‘sound natural' to a native speaker or writer of English?
  When is it acceptable to reuse phrases in academic writing?
  In a recent study (Davis and Morley, 2015), 45 academics from two British universities were surveyed
to determine whether reusing phrases was a legitimate activity for academic writers, and if so, what
kind of phrases could be reused. From the survey and later from in-depth interviews, the following
characteristics for acceptability emerged. A reused phrase:
  • should not have a unique or original construction;
• should not express a clear point of view of another writer;
• depending on the phrase, may be up to nine words in length; beyond this 'acceptability'
declines;
• may contain up to four generic content words (nouns, verbs or adjectives which are not
                                                bound to a specific topic).
Some of the entries in the Academic Phrasebank, contain specific content words which have been
included for illustrative purposes. These words should be substituted when the phrases are used. In
the phrases below, for example, the content words in bold should be substituted:
  5 | Page
• X is a major public health problem, and the cause of ...
• X is the leading cause of death in western-industrialised countries.
The many thousands of disciplinary-specific phrases which can be found in academic communication
comprise a separate category of phrases. These tend to be shorter than the generic phrases listed in
Academic Phrasebank, and typically consist of noun phrases or combinations of these. Acceptability
for reusing these is determined by the extent to which they are used and understood by members of
a particular academic community.
Further work
Development of the website content is ongoing. In addition, research is currently being carried out
on the ways in which experienced and less-experienced writers make use of the Academic
Phrasebank. Another project is seeking to find out more about ways in which teachers of English for
academic purposes make use of this resource.

Introducing Work
There are many ways to introduce an academic essay or short paper. Most academic writers,
however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions:
  • establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic
• indicate an issue, problem, or controversy in the field of study
• define the topic or key terms
• state the purpose of the essay or piece of writing
• provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing
Slightly less complex introductions may simply inform the reader: what the topic is, why it is
important, and how the writing is organised. In very short assignments, it is not uncommon for a
writer to commence simply by stating the purpose of their writing and by indicating how it is
organised.
Introductions to research dissertations and theses tend to be relatively short compared to the other
sections of the text but quite complex in terms of their functional elements. Some of the more
common elements include:
  • establishing the context, background and/or importance of the topic
• giving a brief synopsis of the relevant literature
• highlighting the inadequacy of previous research
• indicating a problem, controversy or a knowledge gap in the field of study
• establishing the desirability of the research
• listing the research questions or hypotheses
• providing a synopsis of the research method(s)
• explaining the significance or value of the study
• defining certain key terms
• providing an overview of the dissertation structure
• explaining reasons for the writer's personal interest in the topic
Examples of phrases which are commonly employed to realise these functions are listed on the
following pages. Note that there may be a certain amount of overlap between some of the
categories under which the phrases are listed. Also, the order in which the different categories of
phrases are shown reflects a typical order but this is far from fixed or rigid, and not all the elements
are present in all introductions.
A number of analysts have identified common patterns in the introductions of research articles.
One of the best known is the CARS model (create a research space) first described by John Swales
(1990)1
. This model, which utilises an ecological metaphor, has, in its simplest form, three elements
or moves:
• Establishing the territory (establishing importance of the topic, reviewing previous work)
• Identifying a niche (indicating a gap in knowledge)
• Occupying the niche (listing purpose of new research, listing questions, stating value,
indicating structure of writing)

Referring to Literature
One of the distinguishing features of academic writing is that it is informed by what is already
known, what work has been done before, and/or what ideas and models have already been
developed. Thus, in academic texts, writers frequently make reference to other studies and to the
work of other authors. It is important that writers guide their readers through this literature. This
section of Academic Phrasebank lists some of the phrases that writers may use for this purpose.
A note on the literature review: It is the purpose of the literature review section of a paper or
dissertation to show the reader, in a systematic way, what is already known about the research
topic as a whole, and to outline the key ideas and theories that help us to understand this. As well
as being systematic, the review should be evaluative and critical of the studies or ideas which are
relevant to the current work. For example, you may think a particular study did not investigate
some important aspect of the area you are researching, that the author(s) failed to notice a
weakness in their methods, or that their conclusion is not well-supported (refer to Being Critical).
A note on referencing style: The way a writer refers to other sources varies somewhat across
different disciplines. In some cases, where the individual author is important, the author’s name will
be the main subject of the sentence; in other cases, the author’s name may only be mentioned in
brackets ( ... ) or via a number notation system (e.g. footnotes and endnotes). The ‘author as
subject’ style is less common in the empirical disciplines (sciences) and more commonly used in the
humanities. Different referencing systems are used in different disciplines. In the majority of the
examples given here, the Harvard in-text referencing system has been used.
A note on verb tenses: For general reference to the literature, the present perfect tense (have/has +
verb participle) tends to be used. For reference to specific studies carried out in the past, the simple
past tense is most commonly used. This is normally the case where a specific date or point in time
in the past forms a part of the sentence. When referring to the words or ideas of writers, the
present tense is often used if the ideas are still relevant, even if the author is no longer alive. The
examples given below reflect these general patterns, but these are by no means rigid.

Describing Methods
In the Methods section of a dissertation or research article, writers give an account of how they
carried out their research. The Methods section should be clear and detailed enough for another
experienced person to repeat the research and reproduce the results. Where the methods chosen
are new, unfamiliar or perhaps even controversial, or where the intended audience is from many
disciplines, the Methods section will tend to be much more extensive. Typical stretches of text
found in this section of a research article or dissertation along with examples of the kind of
language used for these are listed below. Note that for many of the functional categories listed later
in this section, the verbs are written in the simple past tense and are passive.

Reporting Results
The standard approach to this section of a research article or dissertation is to present and describe
the results in a systematic and detailed way. When reporting qualitative results, the researcher will
highlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. These comments will often be
illustrated with excerpts from the raw data. In text based studies, this may comprise quotations from
the primary sources. In quantitative studies, the results section is likely to consist of tables and
figures, and writers comment on the significant data shown in these. This often takes the form of the
location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content, and a
highlighting statement or statements, which point out and describe the relevant or significant data.
All figures and tables should be numbered and given a title.
More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the Discussion section. In
research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented,
and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under
the heading: Results and Discussion.

Discussing Findings
The term ‘discussion’ has a variety of meanings in English. In academic writing, however, it usually
refers to two types of activity: a) considering both sides of an issue, or question before reaching a
conclusion; b) considering the results of research and the implications of these. Discussion sections
in dissertations and research articles are probably the most complex sections in terms of their
elements. They normally centre around a 'statement of result' or an important 'finding'. As there is
usually more than one result, discussion sections are often structured into a series of discussion
cycles. The most common elements in these cycles, and some of the language that is typically
associated with them, are listed below. Note that when offering explanations and suggesting
implications the language used is very tentative or cautious (refer to the section entitled Expressing
Caution).

Writing Conclusions
Conclusions are shorter sections of academic texts which usually serve two functions. The first is to
summarise and bring together the main areas covered in the writing, which might be called ‘looking
back’; and the second is to give a final comment or judgement on this. The final comment may also
include making suggestions for improvement and speculating on future directions.
In dissertations and research papers, conclusions tend to be more complex and will also include
sections on the significance of the findings and on recommendations for future work. In some
research papers, the conclusion is not presented separately from the discussion section; the two
sections may be combined. However, separate conclusions are nearly always expected for
dissertations and essays.

General Functions of Academic Writing
75 | Page
Being Critical
As an academic writer, you are expected to be critical of the sources that you use. This essentially
means questioning what you read and not necessarily agreeing with it just because the information
has been published. Being critical can also mean looking for reasons why we should not just accept
something as being correct or true. This can require you to identify problems with a writer’s
arguments or methods, or perhaps to refer to other people’s criticisms of these. Constructive
criticism goes beyond this by suggesting ways in which a piece of research or writing could be
improved ... being against is not enough. We also need to develop habits of constructive thinking.

Being Cautious
One of the most noticeable stylistic aspects of academic communication is the tendency for writers
to avoid expressing absolute certainty, where there may be a small degree of uncertainty, and to
avoid making over-generalisations, where a small number of exceptions might exist. This means
that there are many instances where the epistemological strength (strength of knowledge) of a
statement or claim is mitigated (weakened) in some way. Writers may also wish to create a degree
of distance between themselves and a statement or claim made by another writer. In the field of
linguistics, devices for lessening the strength of a statement or for creating distance are known as
hedging devices. Analysis of research reports have shown that discussion sections tend to be
particularly rich in hedging devices, particularly where writers are offering explanations for findings.

Classifying and Listing
When we classify things, we group and name them on the basis of something that they have in
common. By doing this we can understand certain qualities and features which they share as a
class. Classifying is also a way of understanding differences between things. In writing, classifying is
often used as a way of introducing a reader to a new topic. Along with writing definitions, the
function of classification may be used in the early part of an essay, or longer piece of writing. We list
things when we want to treat and present a series of items or different pieces of information
systematically. The order of a list may indicate ranked importance.
General classifications
X can be classified into Xi and Xii.
X can be categorised into Xi, Xii and Xiii.
Several taxonomies for X have been developed …
Different methods have been proposed to classify …

Comparing and Contrasting
By understanding similarities and differences between two things, we can increase our
understanding and learn more about both. This usually involves a process of analysis, in which we
compare the specific parts as well as the whole. Comparison may also be a preliminary stage of
evaluation. For example, by comparing specific aspects of A and B, we can decide which is more
useful or valuable. Many paragraphs whose function is to compare or contrast will begin with an
introductory sentence expressed in general terms.
Introducing differences

Defining Terms
In academic work, students are often expected to give definitions of key words and phrases in order
to demonstrate to their tutors that they understand these terms well. Academic writers generally,
however, define terms so that their readers understand exactly what is meant when certain key
terms are used. When important words are not clearly understood misinterpretation may result. In
fact, many disagreements (academic, legal, diplomatic, personal) arise as a result of different
interpretations of the same term. In academic writing, teachers and their students often have to
explore these differing interpretations before moving on to study a topic.
Introductory phrases

thorough understanding of the causes. Some of the language that you may find useful for explaining
causes and effects is listed below.

Giving Examples as Support
Writers may give specific examples as evidence to support their general claims or arguments.
Examples can also be used to help the reader or listener understand unfamiliar or difficult concepts,
and they tend to be easier to remember. For this reason, they are often used in teaching. Finally,
students may be required to give examples in their work to demonstrate that they have understood
a complex problem or concept. It is important to note that when statements are supported with
examples, the explicit language signalling this may not always be used.

Signalling Transition
Previewing what is to follow in a paper or dissertation is like showing a map to a driver; it enables
them to see where they are going. So it is useful to think of a preview section as a 'road map' for the
reader. It must be accurate, but it must be easy to follow.
Writers are also expected to indicate to the reader when they are moving from one topic to
another, or from one section of text to another. These are known as transition statements and
examples of these, together with some previewing statements, are given below (also refer to A note
                                                                              on Academic Presentations).

Describing research history using past tense constructions
The link between X and Y was established in 2000 by Smith et al.
Prior to the work of Smith (1983), the role of X was largely unknown.
Before 1950, the X had received only cursory attention from historians.
The construct of X was first articulated by Smith (1977) and popularised in his book: …
It was not until the late 1960s that historians considered X worthy of scholarly attention.
Awareness of X is not recent, having possibly first been described in the 5th century BCE by …
The next research period involved innovative laboratory work in the late 1960s into the 1970s.
Writing about the past in English is made difficult by the rather complex tense system. However, the
phrases grouped below give an indication of the uses of the main tenses in academic writing. For a
comprehensive explanation of the uses of the various tenses you will need to consult a good English
grammar book. A good recommendation is Practical English Usage by Michael Swan, Oxford
University Press.

                                                               A note on academic style
                                                               The principal characteristics of written academic style are listed below.
                                                               1. Evidence-based
                                                               Perhaps the most important distinguishing feature of written academic style is that it is evidencebased. Writers support their arguments and claims with evidence from the body of knowledge
                                                               relevant to their discipline. In addition, any research that is undertaken must make reference to
                                                               previous work in the field. As a result, academic texts are rich in attributions to other writers and
                                                               references to previous research, as seen in the examples below:
                                                                 • Previous studies have shown that ...

                                                               For further examples, refer to the section on Referring to the Literature in this document.
                                                               In addition, general propositions are usually supported with real examples.
                                                               • This can be seen in the case of ...

                                                               2. Words of classical origin
                                                               Unlike everyday English, academic writing is characterised by a high frequency of words of classical
                                                               origin (Greek and Latin). The main reason for this is that Latin was the lingua academica during the
                                                               European renaissance; in other words, it was the international language of scholars. Even up until
                                                               relatively recently, great works of science, such as Isaac Newton’s Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
                                                               Mathematica (1687), were written in Latin. Where academic texts were written in English, words of
                                                               classical origin were used for concepts and phenomena for which there was no equivalent in English.
                                                               Although the lingua academica of today is English, writers of academic English still tend to use words
                                                               which are derived from Latin, and also, mainly through Latin, from Greek.

                                                               Academic writers are careful about the claims they make: they take care not to appear certain where
                                                               some doubt may exist, and they are careful not to over-generalise. An example of this kind of
                                                               transformation can be seen below. The second sentence is in academic style:

                                                               In the interests of objectivity, academic writers tend to remove themselves from the writing. The
                                                               focus is on ‘what’ happened, ‘how’ it was done, and ‘what’ was found. The ‘who’ (the writer) is not

                                                               normally used for this, ‘you’, is avoided. The second sentence is in academic style:
                                                                 • You could say that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War →
                                                               • It can be said that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War
                                                               There are some exceptions: in certain disciplines, it may be appropriate for a writer to explain their
                                                               personal interest in the research area. In some disciplines, the researcher may participate in the
                                                               research as a participant-observer. In these cases, ‘I’ will be used. The example below, which
                                                               illustrates the former situation, is taken from a dissertation in History.
                                                               I became interested in X after reading …… I hope to convey some of my fascination for the
                                                               subject, as well as expressing my admiration of the artistic achievements of those involved
                                                               In research undertaken by teams, for example in medicine and science, it is common for the research
                                                               to be reported using the personal pronoun, e.g. ‘we’.
                                                               5. Nominalisation
                                                               There is a tendency for academic writers to transform verbs (actions) into nouns. In the example
                                                               below, the verb ‘abandoned’ becomes the abstract noun ‘abandonment’.
                                                               • Unwanted Roman children were generally abandoned in a public place. →
                                                               • The abandonment of unwanted Roman children generally occurred in a public place.
                                                               124 | Page
                                                               As a result of this kind of transformation, academic writing is characterised by long noun phrase
                                                               constructions, as in: ‘the abandonment of unwanted Roman children’. In certain cases, these
                                                               nominalised forms can become long and complex:
                                                                 • the effect of reducing aggressiveness by producing an ACTH-mediated condition of decreased
                                                               androgen levels
                                                               Although this kind of construction is considered normal in scientific writing, unless the reader is
                                                               familiar with the constructions, it does make reading difficult as there are so many pieces of
                                                               information to process in the one sentence. There is an argument that too much nominalisation
                                                               should be discouraged.
                                                               6. Rhetorical questions
                                                               Questions to introduce significant new ideas are avoided, and are replaced with statements:
                                                                 • Is the welfare system good or not? →
                                                               • It is important to consider the effectiveness of the British welfare system.
                                                               7. Contracted forms avoided
                                                               Contracted forms (e.g. it’s, don’t, isn’t, aren’t) should not be used in academic writing. The only
                                                               exception would be if you are transcribing a recorded conversation or interview.
                                                               8. Precise and detailed
                                                               Last of all, one of the most noticeable features of academic writing is that it is very precise and
                                                               detailed. This relates to the setting out and development of the thinking and the ideas, as well as to
                                                               the language used in the writing.
                                                               125 | Page
                                                               A note on style in academic presentations
                                                               In contrast to written style, in academic presentations, the communicative style tends to be much
                                                               more personal and familiar. The majority of the phrases listed below serve as useful ‘signposts’ for
                                                               spoken academic presentations. ‘Signposts’ help the listeners follow where the talk is going. Notice
                                                               how the personal pronouns (‘I’, ‘we’, and ‘you’) are used in most of these phrases.

not show you the correct form. Here is a list of words which are commonly confused:
abbreviation/acronym
An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually, but not always, it consists of a
letter or group of letters taken from the word or phrase. Dr. and Prof. are common examples. An
acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial components in a phrase or a word. These
elements in turn form a new word: NATO, Benelux, UNESCO.
affect/effect
Affect is a verb, e.g. A affects B;
Effect is a noun and is therefore always used after an article/determiner (‘an’ or ‘the’/’this’), e.g. The
Greenhouse Effect.
compliment/complement
Compliment (verb) means to praise someone. Complement (verb) means to complete or add
something in a way that usually improves it. Both words can also be used as nouns.
comprise/consist
Both words mean ‘to be made up of’, but only consist is accompanied by of.
discrete/discreet
Discrete is an adjective which means ‘separate’ or ‘distinct’. Discreet is an adjective which means ‘to
keep silent or tactful about something’.
formerly/formally
Formerly means ‘earlier’. Formally means ‘conventionally’ or ‘officially’.
i.e./e.g.
i.e. is the abbreviation for id est which mean ‘that is’ or ‘in other words’.
e.g. is the abbreviation for exempli gratia which has the same meaning as ‘for example’ and ‘for
instance’.
its/it's
                                                               its – without an apostrophe - is a possessive determiner similar to 'my' or 'your' .
                                                               it's is a contracted form of 'it is' or 'it has' . Note, however, that contracted forms are avoided in
academic writing.
later/latter
Later is an adverb which means ‘at an advanced point of time’. Latter is an adjective used to refer to
an item listed in a text. It means ‘most recently mentioned’; in other words, the last item.
practice/practise
In British English, practice is a noun and practise is a verb. American English allows both spellings for
both forms.

precede/proceed
The verb precede means ‘to come before’. The verb proceed means ‘to go forward’ or ‘to begin to
carry out’.
principle/principal
Principle is a noun which means ‘a basic belief, theory or rule’. Principal is an adjective which means
‘main’ or ‘most important’; it can also refer to a head teacher of a school.
there/their
There is used to indicate the existence of something, e.g. There are two famous football teams in
Manchester. The word their is used to indicate possession, i.e. if something belongs to someone or
something.
prescribe/proscribe
The verb prescribe means to advise or authorise the use of something. The verb proscribe means to
forbid or to restrict.

A note on British and US spelling
The most common difference which is noticed in academic writing concerns verbs which end in
ise/yse Br. or ize/yze US:
• analyse Br. v analyze US.
• industrialise Br. v industrialize US.
• summarise Br. v summarize US.
This difference also affects the nouns derived from the verbs:
• organisation Br. v organization US.
• globalisation Br. v globalization US.
• colonisation Br. v colonization US.
Another noticeable difference relates to words ending in re:
• centre Br. v center US.
• metre Br. v meter US.
• litre Br. v liter US.
Below are some other differences. Can you see any patterns?
British US
aeroplane
analogue
behaviour
catalogue
colour
connection
defence
dialogue
endeavour
encyclopaedia
fibre
foetus
instalment
labour
paediatric
plough
programme
rigour
sceptical
skilful
travelled
airplane
analog
behavior
catalog
color
connexion
defense
dialog
endeavor
encyclopedia
fiber
fetus
installment
labor
pediatric
plow
program
rigor
skeptical
skillful
traveled
If you are writing for a British university or a British journal, you should use the British spelling.

A note on punctuation
As the purpose of punctuation is to make written English easier to read and to make the meaning
clear and unambiguous, good, accurate punctuation is important in academic writing. The following
notes highlight points of particular relevance to academic writing.
1. Full stop .
• To indicate the end of a sentence
• To indicate an abbreviation such as etc., et al. (not always used)
• To indicate an omission in a quoted text [ ... ].
2. Comma ,
• To separate two main parts of a sentence (two clauses) joined by words such as and, or, but,
• To separate a dependent part of a sentence (beginning with words such as although, when,
because) from the main part, particularly if the dependent part comes first in the sentence
• To indicate additional information, however relevant it may be, in a sentence
• To indicate a non-defining relative clause, which simply provides additional information, in a
sentence
• To separate items in a list such as: apples, oranges, and pears (note that the final comma
before and is often omitted).
3. Colon :
• To introduce an explanation: The reason the experiment failed was obvious: the equipment
was faulty.
• To introduce a list, particularly a grammatically complex list. See the example below under
semi-colon
• To introduce a direct quotation, particularly a long one: Jones (2003) states that: ‘ ’.
4. Semi-colon ;
• To separate two sentences that are very closely connected in meaning (optional, in place of a
full stop): Some students prefer to write essays; others prefer to give presentations.
• To separate clearly items in a grammatically complex list: For Aristotle, motion is of four
kinds: (1) motion which ...; (2) motion which ...; (3) motion which ...; and (4) motion which...
5. Quotation marks ‘ ’ / “ ”
• To indicate a direct quotation
• To highlight words or phrases used in a special or unusual way: Quotation marks are also
called ‘inverted commas’.
NB Single quotation marks now seem to be more commonly used than double. For quotations within
quotations, use double quotation marks inside single (or single inside double).
6. Dash –
• Generally avoid in formal academic writing. Replace by colon, semi-colon, or brackets, as
appropriate.

A note on article use
Article use in English is a very complex area. However, there are a few simple rules which will help
you in many situations and these are explained below:
1. Singular countable nouns
All singular countable nouns are always preceded by a small modifying word known in grammar as a
determiner, and this is often an article (a/an, the). Countable words which are common in academic
writing and which often cause problems for non-native speakers of English, include: system, model,
method, approach, group, problem, effect, level, investigation, sector, study, participant, condition,
category
Note that even if these words are preceded by attributive nouns or adjectives, a determiner is still
needed:
• the greenhouse effect, the transport system, the control group
• a high level, a systematic approach, a rigorous study, an exploratory investigation
2. Plural countable nouns
If the writer is thinking about a specific group, then the definite article is normally used: The books
in this collection were published in the 19th or early 20th century.
Otherwise no article is used:
• Learners tend to remember new facts when they are contextualised.
3. Uncountable nouns
Uncountable nouns are not normally accompanied by an article:
• Science has been defined as a systematic approach to answering questions.
• Reliability is an important quality of any test.
But if they are post-modified by of...., or which … the definite article is normally used:
• The science of global warming is a complex and controversial area.
• The reliability of this instrument is poor.
• Chemistry is the science which addresses the composition and behaviour of matter.
133 | Page
4. Names
Names and titles are not normally preceded by the definite article (the)
• Manchester University, Manchester
But this changes if the noun phrase contains a post-modifying structure (of ...)
• The University of Manchester, The United States of America
or if they contain words like organisation, association or institute
• The World Health Organisation, The American Heart Association, The Royal Society. The SETI
Institute
Apart from these simple rules, the other thing you need to do is to check how noun phrases are used
in the texts that you read. Make a mental note of this as you read, or check back to the source text
when you are writing.

A note on sentence structure
1. Simple sentences
In written English, all sentences contain a Subject → Verb structure. The subject always precedes the
verb, except in questions where the order is reversed.
S V
An electron is an elementary particle.
The subject may be one word, but it is usually a group of words centred around a noun. The verb,
which can indicate an action, a state, or simply serve to link the subject to other information, may
also consist of more than one word. Various other sentence elements may be placed before or after
the Subject → Verb structure:
S V
Between 1933 and 1945, restrictions were placed on German academics.
It is common for the subject to consist of many words:
S V
The information on various types of
wasps and bees in the report
was useful to environmentalists who were
fighting the use of pesticides.
Sometimes, however, the subject and verb can just be one word each:
S V
It is almost certain that a lower speed limit will result in fewer injuries to pedestrians.
These simple sentences always end with a full stop. In academic writing, however, many sentences
are more complicated than this simple pattern.
2. Complex sentences
Many sentences contain more than one Subject → Verb structure, but one of these parts (known
grammatically as clauses) will convey the main meaning and will make sense by itself:
Dependent part Main part
 S V S V
Although findings of recent research have shown X, no controlled studies have been reported.
The main part of the sentence is also known as the independent part.
135 | Page
The main part of the sentence can also be placed before the dependent part.
Main part
 S V
 Oral societies tend to be more concerned with the present
Dependent part
 S V
whereas literate societies have a very definite awareness of the past.
The dependent part of complex sentence is usually preceded by a word or phrase such as: although,
even though, if, even if, when, because, as, since, whereas, while (refer to subordinators on the next
page).
3. Compound sentences
Some sentences may have two Subject → Verb structures and each of these convey meaning that
can make sense by itself; in other words, there are two main parts. The two parts may be joined by
words like and, or, but, so, or by using a semi-colon (;) .
S V
Supporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory agree that something is lost as well as gained when
people become literate,
S V
but they consider it is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many others.
4. Common problems relating to sentence structure
Problems occur in writing when dependent parts of sentences are written as complete sentences
with a full stop:
• Whereas literate societies have a very definite awareness of the past. X
• Although a number of studies have been undertaken. X
Problems also occur when two independent parts are written as one sentence without a joining word.
• Supporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory agree that something is lost as well as gained when
people become literate, they consider it is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many
others. X

A note on paragraph structure
A pattern that can be identified in many well-written paragraphs is that of a controlling idea followed
by supporting information. The controlling idea, sometimes referred to as the topic sentence,
introduces a new idea, topic, argument or piece of information into the main text. This is then either
explained further or supported by subsequent sentences. This structure can be represented
schematically thus:
Topic Sentence
(new point, expressed in general terms)
Supporting Information which may include a combination of:
• statistics
• examples
• quotations
• a development in time
• an explanation or reason
• specific aspects or details
• an effect or consequence
• reference to previous research
It is important that the explanatory or supporting information in a paragraph should relate to the
topic sentence. If new points or ideas are to be stated, then these should be treated in a separate
paragraph. It is also important that the explanatory or supporting information should not repeat the
general ideas expressed in the topic sentence.
An example of the kind of paragraph structure suggested above is given below. Note the
development from the general idea to the more detailed information. Also note the thematic linking,
which is signalled by the words in bold, between the sentences. Each of these words and phrases
links back to an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Here, the sentences have been separated.
Many children become interested in competitive sport at early
ages.
Early involvement (prior to maturity) in competitive sport often
exposes individuals to types of stress that may affect their growth,
producing a disruption of the normal growth pattern (Wang, 1978;
Brown, 1998).
Among cyclists the most potentially serious of these disorders is
likely to be increased thoracic curvature.
Cycling alters the anatomical position of the spine (to a flexed
position) particularly the thoracic spine, and exposes the anterior
portion of the vertebral column to higher compression (Smith,
1998; Jones, 2002).

 A note on the writing process
So far this document has been about ‘what we write’. This final section comprises a set of notes
which are concerned with ‘how’ we write. It is organised into a series of helpful tips. Although only
two pages are devoted to these ideas, together they have the potential to make a significant
deference to the quality and quantity of your written output.
Tip No. 1. The importance of planning: Research has shown that
experienced writers plan extensively. Initially, planning may
involve simply generating ideas and exploring the relationships
between them schematically, as in the diagram to the right. At a
more advanced stage of the planning process, a chapter outline of
the thesis or dissertation will be necessary. This will become more
detailed as you work on your study. You need to think of a writing
plan as a road map. Without a map, you will probably lose your
way or travel in circles.
Tip No. 2. Getting started: Many writers suffer from ‘writers’
block’; they find it difficult to get started. One way of overcoming
this is to give yourself a short period of time (say four minutes),
and without stopping, write whatever comes into your mind about
the topic. The important thing to do is to keep writing, or if you are
using a keyboard, to keep typing. Don’t worry about spelling of
grammar – just keep producing words. You will be surprised at
how much text you will produce, and how many ideas are
generated in such a short time. Now you can begin to organise the
ideas you have produced, ensuring that they are written in logically developed and grammatically
correct sentences.
Tip No. 3. Be regular: You should timetable yourself so that you have a regular daily writing slot. This
may seem obvious, but it is fundamental to ensuring the production of written text. Timetable a
writing period each day, and aim to produce some text every time. How much you produce will vary,
and what you produce, even if it is just a few paragraphs, may only be in the initial draft stage. This is
not so important. The important thing is that the writing becomes a part of your daily routine. Simply
getting your body to sit in front of a computer at a certain time each day will produce results.
Tip No. 4. Keep a notebook: When we are writing up a major piece
of work, many ideas and insights come to us when we are not
actually writing. Often, some of the most insightful ideas emerge
when we are in a non-focused cognitive state, such as when we are
walking, running, or swimming. Unless you can capture these ideas
soon after they come to you, they may be lost. A small notebook
and a pen is probably the best way to capture these thoughts
before they disappear. The notebook itself can become a place
where you develop the ideas and even start to formulate how the ideas will be developed in textual
form. 
139 | Page
Tip No. 5. Understand the recursive process: Writing at the
academic level is not something we can do once and then leave. It
is a recursive process. This means writers return to their initial
texts, revising and redrafting them. This process is ongoing. In fact,
many writers find it difficult to stop improving their writing, but
with time being limited, they try to do as much as they can before
the onset of a particular deadline. One thing we do know:
successful writers write initial drafts, redraft, work on final drafts and then edit their work.
Tip No. 6. Read your own writing: Read what you have written back to yourself, out loud if necessary,
and ask yourself: i) do I understand what I have written? ii) does it sound natural? Reading your text
out load is actually the best way of checking this. If what you have written doesn’t sound right to you
when you do this, it is probably badly written. One famous French writer (Gustav Flaubert) used to
shout out his manuscripts before sending them off to be published. He claimed that bad writing
never passed this simple test.
Tip No. 7. Stand back from your writing: Think of yourself as a
mountain climber. Most climbers, during a climb, can only see a
few feet in front of their faces. They cannot see the whole
mountain. They can see other mountains, but not the one they are
climbing. To do this they need to move a few kilometres away. At
such a distance, they can see the route they are planning and they
can see how their planned route moves up the mountain. As a
writer, you should ask yourself: Is the route to the ‘top’ unbroken?
Do all the minor ‘steps’ move upwards? Can the minor ‘steps’ be
‘carried out’ more clearly? The best way to create a sense of distance with your writing is with time:
Leave it a few days, or longer, and comeback to your writing with fresh eyes and with a better sense
of the overall structure.
Tip No. 8. Talk about your writing: Writing is a very solitary activity and we tend not to talk about it
to others. This is quite strange given that we spend so many hours on this activity. Asking another
person to read some of what you have written and to give feedback can be a very useful experience;
particularly if the feedback is reciprocal and both of you receive constructive criticism. It is worth
bearing in mind that academic writers often receive their papers back from journal editors or
publishers asking them to make changes. You might also consider forming a group of writers like
yourself. Together you can read each other’s writing and share the feedback.
